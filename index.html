		<p>My name is Dylan Hong, and I have always cared deeply about animals
			and the environment. In particular, I have always had a deep love
			for the animals that humanity has pushed the closest to extinction.
			What I've always been interested in is the ways to conserve and
			protect these animals at the brink of extinction. This site is
			designed to bring awareness to animals at extinctions gate, their
			story and the ways in which we can help.</p>

		<!-- Make sure your anchor tags have a link (href) and a clickable component -->
		<p>This page is focused primarily on ways that we can help the
			environment around us. I will focus on the Michigan environment and
			how we can protect and sustain the animals in the area particularly
			around Ann Arbor.</p>
